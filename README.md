[DanceMuse](https://github.com/tinydance/DanceMuse) is a bash tool for preprocessing data for music-to-dance generation built on top of 
[OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) and [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/). The current vercion is costumized for 
[DanceRevolution](https://github.com/stonyhu/DanceRevolution), aimed at handling all model preprocessing and testing. 

DanceMuse is developed by [Yuval Ofek](https://github.com/yuvalofek), [Jason Kurian](https://github.com/jkurian49), and [Yuecen (Crystal) Wang](https://github.com/CrystalWang1225)
to facilitate the interaction between artists, specifically choreographers and dancers, and the deep learning community.
